How to drive a stick shift:
Step 1 - To turn on a stick shift car, you have to push the clutch (the pedal that is on the far left) all the way in and turn on the ignition.
Step 2 - With the clutch still pushed in, shift the car into 1 or first gear (reverse if you need to back out).
Step 3 - In order to set the vehicle in motion, slowly reduce pressure on the clutch pedal (thus letting it "out") while simultaneously slowly pressing down the gas pedal until the clutch is all the way out. 
Step 4 - Once the RPMs reach about half the total RPMs possible (if a car "redlines" at 7,000 RPM, half would be about 3,500 RPM), it is time to shift into the next gear.
Step 5 - To shift into the next higher gear once the car is in motion, you fully push in the clutch, switch to the appropriate gear, then repeat Step 3.
Note - Step 5 is significantly easier to preform than Step 3, so when "up-shifting" you don't have to go as slow. 
Step 6 - After having reached the speed limit, stay in the appropriate gear. 
Step 7 - Should you have to stop, shift out of the gear you are in and into neutral (the middle area where there are no gears listed). Use the brake as you would in an automatic car.
Step 8 - After stopping and ready to go again, perform steps 2 through 6 until you have to do step 7 again. 
Congratulations, you can now drive a stick shift! (May require practice)
